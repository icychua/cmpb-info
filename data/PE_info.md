# Exit Permit and Bond

Reference site: https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/before-ns/pre-enlistment-process/exit-permit-and-bond

Under the Enlistment Act 1970, all male Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 13 years and above are required to comply with the Exit Permit requirements. We will send you a letter informing you of these requirements when you turn 13 years old.

Exit Permit requirements are necessary to ensure that National Service (NS)-liable males who reside overseas at a young age or have gone overseas to study will return to Singapore to fulfil their NS responsibilities.


## Exit Permit and bond requirements

There is no need for an exit permit if:
a. You are going overseas for less than 3 months; or
b. You are less than 13 years old.

You will need an Exit Permit if you are:
a. Between 13 to 16.5 years old; and
b. Going overseas for more than 3 months to less than 2 years.

You will need an Exit Permit along with a bond in the form of a Banker's guarantee for all other scenarios.

## After an Exit Permit has been granted

Take note that:

- If you are studying overseas, an Exit Permit can be granted for the full duration of your course. Where an Exit Permit has been granted for a course of study and there is a change in the details such as the course, place of study, institution that you are studying at, please refer to our FAQ on Exit Permit for more information.
- If you are unable to return to Singapore before the expiry of your Exit Permit, you will be required to apply for an extension. We will consider your request on a case-by-case basis. Please note that failure to return to Singapore before the expiry of your Exit Permit may result in your bond being forfeited and you having committed an offence.
You can apply, renew, extend, cancel or check the status of your Exit Permit through OneNS.

## Exit Permit Offences
Any NS-liable male aged between 13 years old and 16.5 years old who is in breach of the Enlistment Act 1970 may be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000. Any such persons may not be sufficiently mature to understand their obligations under the Enlistment Act 1970. Each parent, guardian or person having actual custody will also be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000.

# MEDICAL SCREENING AND PSYCHOMETRIC TEST

Reference site: https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/before-ns/pre-enlistment-process/medical-screening-and-psychometric-test

During your online pre-enlistment documentation, you will be prompted to book a medical screening appointment. The medical screening will determine your medical fitness for NS, which impacts the type of basic training and vocation you can be assigned to. A psychometric test will also be conducted on the same day. You can book your first medical screening during the National Service registration online exercise. If needed, you may log in to OneNS to change your appointment date at least three days in advance.

## What to bring for medical screening

On the day of your medical screening, you will be asked to:

Take your photo at the Photo Studio; and
Complete the e-fitting process for us to obtain your body measurements. This is so that you can be issued with the uniform, boots, apparels and other National Service (NS) equipment of the right size for your NS training on your enlistment day.
Please observe and follow the instructions in the following checklist on the day of your medical screening. Do note that failure to observe these instructions may require you to come back on multiple occasions to complete your medical screening, resulting in delays to your screening process and possibly your enlistment. We will not make any exceptions to our requirements and you will be asked to come back again should you come unprepared or without the right documents.

Bring any two of the following Identity Documents:
- NRIC
- Student EZ-Link card
- Passport
- Driving license

Bring medical documents (if applicable):
- Medical reports
- Hostpital appointment cards
- X-ray films
- Blood donation card
- School health booklet

### What should I wear?
Attire:
- T-shirt
- Shorts/pants
- Wear spectacles if you are bespectabled

Personal Grooming:
- Clean shave
- Neat and short haircut for photo-taking

Not allowed
- Contact lenses
- Coloured, long, or messy haircut
- Jewellery

## Medical Screening Stations

There are six stations in the medical screening process and they will take about 2.5 hours to complete. Should there be any abnormalities detected as you go through the respective stations, you may be asked to go for a further medical review.

You will be medically graded in accordance with the Singapore Armed Forces Medical Classification Guidelines and assigned a Physical Employment Standard (PES) grade. Your PES is one of the considerations to determine your deployment during your full-time National Service. You will be able to check your definitive PES on eHealth if you are not required to attend any further medical review in a month’s time.

## Physical employment standard (PES)

The Physical Employment Standard (PES) is assigned based on your medical condition and is one of the considerations to determine your vocation during your National Service (NS) period. Should your PES change due to your medical conditions during your NS period, you may be reassigned to a different vocation or appointment accordingly.

- PES A: suitable for combat vocations
- PES B1: suitable for combat vocations
- Pes B2: Suitable for some combat vocations, and combat support vocations
- Pes B3: Suitable for some combat vocations, and combat support vocations
- Pes B4: Suitable for some combat vocations, and combat support vocations
- Pes BP: Fit for Obese BMT
- PES C2: Suitable for some combat support vocations, and combat service support vocations
- PES C9: Suitable for some combat support vocations, and combat service support vocations
- PES D (Only applicable to pre-enlistees): Temporarily unfit for grading and pending further review
- PES E1: Suitable for combat service support and service vocations
- PES E9: Suitable for combat service support and service vocations

## Psychometric test

You will be required to sit for a computer-based psychometric test on the same day you attend your medical screening. This test is conducted at the Vocational Assessment Centre (VAC) in CMPB and usually takes about 1.5 hours to complete. Please be punctual for your medical screening appointment. Otherwise, you may be asked to report for your psychometric test on another day.

The psychometric test scores are used to place servicemen in vocations or appointments where their abilities can be best used to maximise our limited manpower. Your test scores will be used as one of the factors in decisions subsequently, including assignment to a vocation and selection for leadership courses. You should put in as much effort as possible to do the tests well and accurately.

### What the tests are like

The psychometric test is designed to measure aptitude in a range of domains such as reasoning, technical and mental-spatial abilities. It is delivered on a computerised adaptive testing system, which means that the test adapts to your ability level. The computer software selects questions that are suitable for you based on your responses to earlier questions. You will not be able to review or change your answers once you have submitted an answer to a question.

## Medical Review

After your medical screening, you may be given a Physical Employment Standard (PES) D. This means more information is needed before your PES can be determined. This can happen if more relevant documents and/or medical investigations are required. In the case of the latter, you may be asked to attend specialist appointments at restructured hospitals.

The actual number of medical reviews that you will be required to attend depends on the nature and complexity of your medical conditions. These medical reviews are critical and important to allow us to determine your medical fitness for full-time National Service (NS).
